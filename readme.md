# Full Stack Developer Quiz

This is a quick Laravel application. If you're comfortable with Laravel and a javascript framework, the whole thing should take about an hour. The isntructions are on the home page of the poject itself, but at a high level, this quiz will ask you to:

  - Fork the github repo
  - Clone the Laravel application locally
  - Create 2 Models, Controllers, Database Migrations, and seeds for a given schema (again, an outline will be provided)
  - Create a bootstrap form that reflects those models
  - Create a VueJS, AngularJS (or equivilant) model that is bound to the form
  - Use VueJS/Agular/whatever to perform CRUD tasks on these two related models.
  - Send everything back in a pull request
  - Email mike@lojistic.com and let him know that you're done
